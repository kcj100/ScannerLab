## 2. What are Collections and why Use Them?
- Collections are Java data structures used to store and manage groups of objects.
- They provide a way to organize and manipulate data in a structured manner.
- Collections are used to handle data efficiently and simplify complex operations.

## 3. Collections with Iteration Order: List

- A List is a collection that maintains the order of elements.
- It allows duplicate elements and provides methods for indexed access.
- Common implementations include ArrayList and LinkedList.

## 4. Storing Key / Value Pairs: Maps
- Maps are collections used to store key-value pairs.
- They provide fast lookup and retrieval of values based on keys.
- Examples of Map implementations are HashMap, TreeMap, and LinkedHashMap.

## 7. Collections with Uniqueness: Sets
- Sets are collections that store unique elements (no duplicates).
- They ensure that each element is distinct.
- Common Set implementations include HashSet, TreeSet, and LinkedHashSet.
